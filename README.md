# Dummy
This is a dummy repo. Uses:
* Practising entering Git commands into a UNIX terminal (Windows Powershell and Git Bash should also be fine)
* Giving tutorials about using said git commands

...all without spoiling precious work in another repo.

Git topics to cover/practise:
* Cloning
* Adding
* Commiting
* Pushing
* Pulling
* Fetching
* Branches: creating and switching between them. Also mention the significance of master and dev branches.

Further topics:
* Resetting commits
* Merging
